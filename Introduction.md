# Introduction #

roble is the code name for a project representing a physics-based game. The project was initially discussed on June 20, 2009 and after a lengthy brainstorm session, the goal of a physics-based game was decided upon.


# Details #

Some tentative goals:
  * Use a 2D game world.
  * Represent various structure primitives with distinct physical properties and behavior.
  * Allow for destruction of the structures by a few methods.
  * Possibly create structures from images.
  * Hopefully some multi-player elements.
  * Ideally a structure editor of some sort.
  * The ability to use google sketch to generate structures would be nice.
